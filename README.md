# LecternBook

LecternBook is a Minecraft plugin that allows players to read written books placed on a lectern directly through the game interface. With simple controls, you can interact with a lectern and read books page-by-page, creating a smoother experience for those who want to immerse themselves in written content without taking the book in hand. Whether you're managing an in-game library, crafting intricate stories, or using books for education, LecternBook provides an intuitive way to browse written books directly from the lectern.

## How It Works

### 1. Placing a Book on the Lectern
To use LecternBook, first place a written book on the lectern. You can do this by right-clicking on the lectern with a written book in your hand.

### 2. Reading the Book
Once a book is placed on the lectern, simply **left-click** on the lectern to begin reading. The book will open in a readable format, and you can browse through its pages.

### 3. Navigating Pages
If you want to jump to a specific page of the book, you can use the `/page [page number]` command. For example:
- `/page 2` will take you to page 2 of the book.
- `/page 5` will jump directly to page 5.

Use the command while standing near the lectern to switch pages smoothly.

### 4. Supported Interaction
- **Left mouse button click**: Opens the book placed on the lectern and allows you to read its contents.
- **Page command**: Allows navigation to a specific page in the book without needing to manually flip through pages.

## Commands

- `/page [page number]`
